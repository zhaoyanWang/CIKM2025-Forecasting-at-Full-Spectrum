Forecasting at Full Spectrum: Holistic Multi-Granular Traffic Modeling under High-Throughput Inference Regimes -CIKM2025

This is an anonymous repository for paper manuscript "Forecasting at Full Spectrum: Holistic Multi-Granular Traffic Modeling under High-Throughput Inference Regimes" submitted to CIKM2025 Full Research Track. 
Due to CIKM's call for availability in anonymity, and helping reviewers easily check some details: 
Hence, we provide patial and key segments of Data, Scripts, Model Structures, trained model and prediction outputs for review process if needed. ##Tentative to be fully open-sourced after Acceptance, as appropriate!##. 

Contents available: 

Raw data CSV, npz 
Data processing, multi-granularity generation scripts processed data, train&test&val datasets npz 
Scripts for MultiGran-STGCN and distributed parallel inference scheduling, model structures of MultiGran-STGCN, ablation variants and all baselines, profiling script and profiled data on devices in clusters etc. 
Model training & Evaluation results including best weight, evaluation logs, and npz prediction details.
